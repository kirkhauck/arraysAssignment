## How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?
I feel fairly confident with arrays. The methods are a little intimidating because I don't know any,
but that will go away with practice.


## Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?
I need to right down the simple commands used in the lesson on a sticky note and put it on my board
for easy reference. I also need to review what .slice does. I believe it grabs a "slice" of the index
depending on what you put at the start and the end (if you choose to add an end), but I'm still
not confident what the result will be when I enter the code.


## What questions do you have about Arrays?
How does .slice exactly work?
MDN said that .pop removes the last element of an array and **returns it**. What does it mean by
"returns it?"What questions do you have about Arrays?
